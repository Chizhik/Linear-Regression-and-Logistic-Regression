# Linear-Regression-and-Logistic-Regression
This is my implementation of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression using python and numpy.

In this work, I used two LIBSVM datasets which are pre-processed data originally from UCI data repository.

1. Linear regression - Housing dataset (housing scale dataset). Predict housing values in suburbs of Boston. https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/regression/housing_scale.
2. Logistic regression - Adult dataset (I only use a3a training dataset). Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. https: //www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary/a3a
